# Thesis-Efficient-simulation-of-non-markovian-dynamics-using-Max-Ent-states-
In my licenciatura (roughly Bachelor+Master in Physics equivalent), with my director J.M. Matera, we worked in both analytical and computational techniques for the study of non-markovian quantum systems using Max-Ent approximation for instantaneous states, the latter with open code and hand-made also.
