# Thesis-Efficient-simulation-of-non-markovian-dynamics-using-Max-Ent-states-

In my Licenciatura's Thesis (a requirement to gain the title of Licenciado in Physics, roughly Bachelor+Master in Physics equivalent, 5 year-curriculum) with my director J.M. Matera, we worked in both analytical and computational techniques for the study of non-markovian quantum systems using Max-Ent approximation for instantaneous states, the latter with open code and hand-made also. In this repository, I've uploaded the .tex file of said thesis.
