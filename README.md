In my Licenciatura's Thesis (a requirement to gain the title of Licenciado in Physics, roughly Bachelor+Master in Physics equivalent, 5 year-curriculum) with my director J.M. Matera, we worked in both analytical and computational techniques for the study of non-markovian quantum systems using Max-Ent approximation for instantaneous states, the latter with open code and hand-made also. In this repository, I've uploaded the .tex file of said thesis. 

## Abstract

In this work we will study the problem of solving the Schr√∂dinger and Lindblad equations - the dynamics - for a non-Markovian system, a problem of **NP-hard** complexity, by the means of approximating the instantaneous states by **Max-Ent**-type states, counting only up to two-body correlations, a problem of **P** complexity. To that end, we implemented the **Gaussian dynamics** formalism for such systems and a new Gaussian dynamics approach as an application of the Max-Ent Principle for the description of open and closed dynamics for non-Markovian quantum systems.
